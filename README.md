# hello-world
for testing

this repository was created to get used to basic branch management with github.

And I just initialized this rep by using the command "git init hello-world"

BTW, you commit using "git commit -m "some comment on what you did."
But you have to add to a list of commits up-front using either
"git add ." to commit everything or "git add <filename/filefolder>"
Then you can commit as mentioned above.
